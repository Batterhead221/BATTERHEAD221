# Brandon Shelly  
Hardware & PCB Design Engineer  

I design, build, and debug real hardware with a focus on **power electronics, PCB layout, and bring-up**.  
My work emphasizes **electrical correctness, EMI-aware routing, and debug-first design**.

I have over 8 years of hands-on experience in electronics, including work on aerospace and defense-adjacent projects, and I specialize in boards that power up cleanly and can be validated efficiently.

## 📁 Featured Project
### **12V → 5V Buck Converter Module (LMR51430)**

A compact synchronous buck converter designed for real-world validation and reuse in embedded systems.

- 12 V input, 5 V regulated output  
- 2 A continuous (3 A peak silicon capability)  
- EMI-conscious 2-layer layout  
- Dedicated test points for all critical nodes

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
- Layout decisions are driven by current flow, not aesthetics
- Power integrity matters more than trace symmetry
- Every board should be debuggable without guesswork
- Conservative ratings build trust
